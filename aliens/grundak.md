title: Grundak
homeworld: Rani (Thord-0002)
threat_level: II / Low chance of rebellion. Monopoly on Tharnite.

description:
  - 'The Grundak are a robust, labor-oriented species shaped by the extreme conditions of their high-gravity homeworld, Rani, a mineral-rich planet. Evolved for endurance, they excel in physically demanding environments, making them critical assets for mining, engineering, and heavy-world operations. Commonly referred to as "Gruds" in trade circles. Harmonia Astralis assesses the Grundak as a utilitarian resource for labor and defense sectors, but their cultural emphasis on independence and clan loyalty requires careful diplomatic handling to prevent rebellion. Their exceptional resilience and technical expertise make them valuable, though their propensity for prolonged vendettas poses risks of resistance if mismanaged.'
  - 'Grundak stand 4.5–5.5 feet tall with broad, muscular builds optimized for high-gravity environments. Their dense skeletal structure and reinforced musculature allow them to withstand extreme physical stress. Skin ranges from pale to ashen, marked by labor-induced scarring and soot within years of adulthood. Their eyes, adapted for low-light conditions, provide enhanced vision in dim environments. Hands feature three thick fingers and a thumb, calloused for precision work despite their bulk, though they often require customized tools ("Grud-grips") for off-world equipment. Male Grundak grow elaborate, unshaven beards from adolescence, adorned with beads, rings, or bands signifying clan, rank, or achievements, which are central to identity; disrespecting them invites hostility. Females share similar builds but lack beards.'

traits:
  - name: "Hearty Constitution"
    description: "Their robust physiology ensures maximum vitality at each stage of development. Mechanically, Grundak always roll the maximum value for the first hit die when gaining a level (e.g., a Level 1 Warrior starts with 8 HP). At higher levels, any hit die rolling a 1 is re-rolled until a higher value is achieved, reflecting their exceptional toughness."
  - name: "Gravity-Forged"
    description: "Adapted to Rani’s high-gravity environment, Grundak ignore fatigue, bone stress, and pressure penalties in high-gravity conditions. They gain a +1 bonus to physical skill checks (e.g., Exert, Combat/Melee) in such environments but receive no bonus or penalty in standard or low-gravity settings. In zero-gravity, they suffer a -1 penalty to fine motor skills due to disorientation."
  - name: "Born Fixers"
    description: "Grundak culture instills mechanical aptitude from an early age. All Grundak start with the Fix skill at Rank 0 (or +1 if already trained), enabling them to maintain and repair complex systems with minimal training. However, their reliance on specialized tools can lead to delays when adapting to non-Grundak equipment."

threat_profile:
  - "While not overtly hostile, Grundak mercenary enclaves have been observed selling Tharnite-derived tech to independent actors and suspected subversives. Their decentralized cultural structure makes centralized diplomacy difficult, and their memory for historical grievances can reignite conflicts long believed dormant."
  - "In high-pressure environments or frontier stations, Grundak workers often become informal leaders through sheer reliability and presence. Subversion risk is moderate. Suppression should emphasize economic leverage rather than direct confrontation."
