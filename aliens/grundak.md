title: Grundak
homeworld: Rani (Thord-0002)
threat_level: II / Low chance of rebellion. Monopoly on Tharnite.

description:
  - "The Grundak are a subterranean species of stout, broad-bodied humanoids evolved under the heavy gravity and seismic instability of their mountainous world, Rani. Adapted to survive crushing pressures and tectonic chaos, Grundak settlements are masterpieces of seismic engineering—modular, mobile, and nearly indestructible."
  - "As natural miners and engineers, the Grundak maintain a monopoly on the rare mineral Tharnite, a red crystalline substance essential to high-density energy storage. Though their society appears austere and slow-moving, it is backed by centuries of technical refinement and an unshakable memory for insult or debt."

traits:
  - name: "Hearty Constitution"
    description: "First die for HP each level is always the max value. At level 2+, any 1s are also rerolled."
  - name: "Gravity-Forged"
    description: "Immune to heavy gravity-based fatigue, bone stress, and pressure shock."
  - name: "Born Fixers"
    description: "Grants the Fix skill as a bonus at level 1."

threat_profile:
  - "While not overtly hostile, Grundak mercenary enclaves have been observed selling Tharnite-derived tech to independent actors and suspected subversives. Their decentralized cultural structure makes centralized diplomacy difficult, and their memory for historical grievances can reignite conflicts long believed dormant."
  - "In high-pressure environments or frontier stations, Grundak workers often become informal leaders through sheer reliability and presence. Subversion risk is moderate. Suppression should emphasize economic leverage rather than direct confrontation."
