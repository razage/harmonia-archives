title: Velari
homeworld: Mayrifa (Permago-0706)
threat_level: IV / High Psionic Potential

description:
  - 'The Velari are a willowy, psionically gifted species from the tidally locked world of Mayrifa, a low-gravity planet divided between eternal daylight and perpetual darkness. Their elongated forms and exceptional psychic aptitude make them a unique presence in the sector. Comprising two subspecies—Solarin, adapted to constant sunlight, and Nocturnis, evolved for endless night—the Velari share a cultural reverence for metaphysical inquiry and psionic mastery. Known as "Vel" in casual settings, derogatory terms like "Spooks" or "Wraiths" (particularly for Nocturnis) risk inciting hostility, especially among psionically sensitive individuals. Harmonia Astralis regards the Velari as valuable for intelligence and diplomatic operations, but their psionic capabilities and environmental fragility pose risks of unpredictable influence or covert manipulation if not closely monitored.'

traits:
  - name: "Low-G Adaptation"
    description: "Velari physiology is optimized for low-gravity, thin-atmosphere environments like Mayrifa. On standard or high-gravity worlds, they must wear a supportive exosuit to avoid physical strain. Without a suit, after 1 hour of exertion, they suffer a -1 penalty to all rolls and accrue fatigue until they rest in a suitable environment or regain suit assistance. In microgravity or shipboard conditions, they navigate with exceptional ease, treating zero-G as second nature."
  - name: "Psychic Aptitude"
    description: "All Velari must be of the Psychic class or take the Partial Psychic option from the Adventurer class. Their maximum Effort score is increased by +1, reflecting their innate psionic attunement. Psychic abilities typically manifest early, with societal training treating psionics as a rite of passage, enhancing their mental versatility and influence."
  - name: "Thermal Sight (Nocturnis)"
    description: "Nocturnis Velari perceive the infrared spectrum, detecting heat signatures through walls up to 1 meter thick and in total darkness, equivalent to thermal goggles. However, they cannot distinguish shapes of similar temperatures or perceive the standard visible spectrum, rendering glass, standard screens, and LEDs invisible without specialized aids."
  - name: "Solar Precision (Solarin)"
    description: "In bright light (natural or synthetic), Solarin Velari gain a +1 bonus to Notice, Ranged Combat, and vision-based skill checks. Effects relying on bright light, such as the visual component of a flashbang, do not affect them. In low light or darkness, they suffer a -1 penalty to Notice, Ranged Combat, and vision-based skills, as their biological optical filters hinder performance. Night vision or thermal vision does not grant the bonus in low-light conditions."

threat_profile:
  - "High individual psionic capability. Avoid direct confrontation unless overwhelming force is available. Preferred operational posture: surveillance, containment, and controlled recruitment."
