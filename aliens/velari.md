title: Velari
homeworld: Mayrifa (Permago-0706)
threat_level: IV / High Psionic Potential

description:
  - "The Velari are a willowy, psionically potent species native to the tidally locked world of Mayrifa.
    Their divergent evolution has produced two subspecies: the pale-skinned Nocturnis, adapted to the planet’s eternal night, and the tanned Solarin, born beneath its fixed sun. Though their frames appear fragile, their minds are razor-edged and attuned to unseen layers of reality."
  - "Velari are calm, introspective, and deeply embedded in a cultural tradition that reveres the mind’s reach. They view psionics as a natural language of the cosmos—one that predates even speech. Infiltration or subversion is challenging; their unity and perception make them formidable even unarmed. Caution advised."

traits:
  - name: "Psionic Aptitude"
    description: "Must begin as a Psychic or take the Partial Psychic option from the Adventurer class. Gains +1 to their maximum Effort."
  - name: "Low-G Adaptation"
    description: "Operates comfortably in low gravity or zero-g. Tires much quicker in standard or heavy gravity. -1 to all physically-taxing rolls for each hour they spend in standard gravity."
  - name: "Subspecies Selection"
    description: "Nocturnis have Infrared vision and cannot perceive the standard viewable spectrum. Solarin have standard vision, but gain a +1 bonus when resisting flash effects."

threat_profile:
  - "High individual psionic capability. Avoid direct confrontation unless overwhelming force is available. Preferred operational posture: surveillance, containment, and controlled recruitment."
