overview:
  - "The Velari are a willowy, psionically gifted species from the tidally locked world of Mayrifa, a low-gravity planet divided between eternal daylight and perpetual darkness. Comprising two subspecies—Solarin, adapted to constant sunlight, and Nocturnis, evolved for endless night—they exhibit exceptional psychic aptitude and graceful movement. Known as 'Vel' in casual settings, derogatory terms like 'Spooks' or 'Wraiths' (particularly for Nocturnis) risk inciting hostility, especially among psionically sensitive individuals. Harmonia Astralis regards the Velari as valuable for intelligence and diplomatic operations, but their psionic capabilities and environmental fragility present risks of covert manipulation or unpredictable influence if not closely monitored."

physical_assessment:
  - title: Physiology
    description: "Velari stand 7–8.5 feet tall with slender, elongated limbs suited for low-gravity movement. Their upswept, foot-long ears serve auditory and expressive functions, signaling mood through subtle movements. **Solarin Velari** have bronze-to-gold skin and iridescent, crystalline eyes that filter solar glare, complementing their sun-inspired aesthetics. **Nocturnis Velari** are pale, near-translucent, with luminous, pupil-less eyes adapted for infrared vision, giving them an eerie, fragile appearance. Both subspecies move with graceful precision but are physically vulnerable in standard or high-gravity environments without support."
  - title: Strategic Implications
    description: "Their psionic capabilities make Velari exceptional for intelligence gathering, diplomacy, or covert operations, but physical fragility in non-native environments limits direct combat utility. Nocturnis excel in dark or concealed settings, while Solarin thrive in well-lit conditions, creating situational advantages. Their reliance on exosuits in standard gravity offers an exploitable vulnerability."

behavioral_profile:
  - title: Societal Structure
    description: "Velari society is unified by a shared spiritual and metaphysical focus, with psionics viewed as a pathway to universal truths. Solarin and Nocturnis communities maintain distinct cultural practices but collaborate closely, often bridging differences through psionic communion. Their isolationist history fosters introspection over expansion, though they engage readily with off-world allies."
  - title: Behavioral Traits
    description: "Contemplative and reserved, Velari prioritize mental discipline and artistic expression. Solarin are more outgoing, while Nocturnis lean toward introspection, but both subspecies exhibit fierce loyalty to their kin and ideals. Their psionic sensitivity can make them unpredictable when emotionally provoked."
  - title: Strengths
    description: "Exceptional psionic potential and environmental adaptability (Nocturnis in darkness, Solarin in light) make Velari ideal for specialized roles in reconnaissance, negotiation, or psychic operations. Their low-gravity agility enhances performance in space or microgravity settings."
  - title: Weaknesses
    description: "Physical fragility in standard or high-gravity environments requires exosuit dependence, limiting operational range. Nocturnis’ inability to perceive visible light restricts interaction with standard technology, while Solarin’s low-light penalties hinder versatility. Psionic overreach can lead to mental strain, exploitable through prolonged engagements."
  - title: Strategic Risks
    description: "Velari psionic abilities pose a significant threat for covert manipulation or intelligence breaches, particularly in unsecured environments. Their cultural unity could galvanize resistance if their homeworld or communities are threatened. Monitor psionic activity and inter-subspecies communications for signs of coordinated action."

traits:
  - name: "Low-G Adaptation"
    description: "Velari physiology is optimized for low-gravity, thin-atmosphere environments like Mayrifa. On standard or high-gravity worlds, they must wear a supportive exosuit to avoid physical strain. Without a suit, after 1 hour of exertion, they suffer a -1 penalty to all rolls and accrue fatigue until they rest in a suitable environment or regain suit assistance. In microgravity or shipboard conditions, they navigate with exceptional ease, treating zero-G as second nature."
  - name: "Psychic Aptitude"
    description: "All Velari must be of the Psychic class or take the Partial Psychic option from the Adventurer class. Their maximum Effort score is increased by +1, reflecting their innate psionic attunement. Psychic abilities typically manifest early, with societal training treating psionics as a rite of passage, enhancing their mental versatility and influence."
  - name: "Thermal Sight (Nocturnis)"
    description: "Nocturnis Velari perceive the infrared spectrum, detecting heat signatures through walls up to 1 meter thick and in total darkness, equivalent to thermal goggles. However, they cannot distinguish shapes of similar temperatures or perceive the standard visible spectrum, rendering glass, standard screens, and LEDs invisible without specialized aids."
  - name: "Solar Precision (Solarin)"
    description: "In bright light (natural or synthetic), Solarin Velari gain a +1 bonus to Notice, Ranged Combat, and vision-based skill checks. Effects relying on bright light, such as the visual component of a flashbang, do not affect them. In low light or darkness, they suffer a -1 penalty to Notice, Ranged Combat, and vision-based skills, as their biological optical filters hinder performance. Night vision or thermal vision does not grant the bonus in low-light conditions."

operational_recommendations:
  - title: "Engagement Strategy"
    description: "Recruit Velari for psionic or diplomatic roles, providing exosuits and light-tailored environments to maximize effectiveness. Respect their metaphysical traditions to secure loyalty and foster cooperation."
  - title: "Containment Measures"
    description: "Counter Nocturnis with visible-spectrum barriers (e.g., glass) and Solarin with low-light conditions to disrupt their advantages. Deploy anti-psionic countermeasures or high-gravity traps to limit their operational capacity."
  - title: "Escalation Protocols"
    description: "Neutralize threats with physical containment in high-gravity environments or targeted anti-psionic measures. Target leadership to fracture subspecies unity, avoiding actions that could unify Solarin and Nocturnis against external forces."

  text: "The Velari see beyond the veil of the material, their minds as sharp as their bodies are fragile—a duality to be both harnessed and feared."
