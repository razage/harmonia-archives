overview:
  - "The Zhivari, an ancient humanoid insectoid species, inhabit the caustic, frozen world of Tireus, dwelling in vast underground cities sustained by geothermal vents. Their physiology, uniquely adapted to metabolize Tireus’s toxic atmosphere, precludes survival in standard environments, restricting off-world contact. A tech level 2 society riven by tribal civil war, the Zhivari split into factions with divergent attitudes toward outsiders: the Qardi trade with the Exchange, while hostile tribes brandish crude explosives and crossbows against intruders. Their resources and ancestral artifacts hold economic and potential pretech value, but their insular conflicts challenge Harmonia Astralis’s strategic interests on Tireus."

physical_assessment:
  - title: Caustic Respiration
    description: "Zhivari rely on a chemosynthetic respiratory system, metabolizing Tireus’s sulfurous, ammonia-rich atmosphere through enzyme-driven catalysis in spiracle-like lungs. This bonds caustic gases with trace oxygen for bioenergy, but standard atmospheres trigger cellular collapse within minutes, akin to acid poisoning. Off-Tireus survival requires sealed suits filled with artificial caustic air, confining them to geothermal-heated cities and hindering diplomacy."
  - title: Chitinous Exoskeleton
    description: "Zhivari stand 5 to 7 feet, their lightweight, segmented exoskeletons—iridescent blue-green to mottled gray—shielding against Tireus’s winds and low-tech weapons. Four arms (two primary, two secondary) with clawed digits excel at burrowing and tool use. Luminescent compound eyes and vibration-sensitive antennae navigate dimly lit caverns. Their acrid odor and proboscis-like mouths, adapted for fungal diets, unsettle outsiders, impeding persuasion."

behavioral_profile:
  - title: Tribal Fractiousness
    description: "Zhivari society fractures into warring tribes competing over geothermal vents and sacred artifacts. Hostile tribes, such as Vex’kar and Thul’dri, repel outsiders with guerrilla tactics—venom-tipped crossbows and caustic explosives—guarding their resources. The Qardi, conversely, trade with the Exchange, offering cautious cooperation but prioritizing artifact sanctity."
  - title: Artifact Veneration
    description: "Each tribe cherishes unique, vent-forged artifacts—idols, totems, or jewelry—believed to embody ancestral power, possibly of pretech origin. Guarded with fanatical zeal, these relics provoke violent retaliation if threatened, complicating covert operations on Tireus."
  - title: Limited Communication
    description: "Zhivari communicate via chittering clicks, antenna vibrations, and pheromones, requiring TL3 translators for comprehension. Only rare elders, like Shiz’lo of the Qardi, speak broken Common, limiting negotiations and necessitating reliance on Exchange intermediaries."
  - title: Xenophobic Variability
    description: "While the Qardi exhibit openness, hostile tribes fear atmospheric ‘poisoning’ by off-world technology, viewing outsiders as threats to vents and artifacts. Their coordinated ambushes demand cautious engagement, as unpredictability risks operational losses."
  - title: Geothermal Dependency
    description: "Zhivari culture centers on geothermal vents, providing heat, power, and fungal sustenance. Rituals—etching chitin scrolls, weaving fungal tapestries—revolve around these ‘heart-vents,’ making territorial disputes existential. Interference, such as mining, escalates tribal conflicts."

operational_recommendations:
  - title: Qardi Relations
    description: "Prioritize diplomacy with the Qardi, leveraging Shiz’lo and the Exchange as liaisons to secure trade. Offer advanced technology to foster trust and encourage artifact disclosure, ensuring Harmonia Astralis’s access to their resources without provoking hostility."
  - title: Neutralize Hostile Tribes
    description: "Deploy covert teams with sensors to detect Zhivari pheromone trails, countering ambushes. Apply overwhelming force to neutralize hostile tribes, allowing survivors to retreat and reveal their vent locations and artifact caches."
  - title: Artifact Acquisition Strategy
    description: "Engage stealth teams for artifact retrieval. Secure relics in vaults to prevent tribal retaliation. Extract the vaults with haste to cripple their ability to retaliate."
