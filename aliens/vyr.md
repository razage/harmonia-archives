title: Vyr
homeworld: Pane (Kochasigi-0511)
threat_level: V / Existential threat to the sector / Psionic Hazard

description:
  - "First contact with the Vyr coincided with the total loss of Pane, now considered their staging world. Their origin remains unknown, but they seized the planet with overwhelming force—without warning, mercy, or any attempt at communication."
  - "Vyr constructs—if such a term applies—range from glider-sized, chitin-shrouded organisms to orbital-scale megastructures capable of independent spaceflight. No conventional crew have been observed aboard these vessels, and no discernible language has been recorded. They take no prisoners and engage in no diplomacy."
  - "It is strongly suspected the Vyr originated beyond this sector. Their technology is not built, but grown. Their weapons are not mounted, but excreted or formed. Conservative estimates place their forces in the millions. Without intervention, further conquests appear inevitable."
  - 'Despite the catastrophic threat they pose, Vyr biology offers exploitable resources. Their nesting grounds and the remains of ship-sized entities contain a crystalline mineral dubbed "Vyrtite". A related compound, a corrosive substance named "Nhalex", appears integral to their digestion and energy systems. When stabilized using a hazardous refining process, Vyrtite becomes "Vyracite"—a semi-living material with limited self-repair properties. It is highly valued for use in vehicle hulls and specialized armor systems.'

traits:
  - name: "CLARIFICATION"
    description: "Reliable simulation or impersonation remains impossible. No Vyr has communicated in a decipherable format, and infiltration efforts have failed. The following data is based solely on field observation and limited autopsy reports."
  - name: "Adaptive Bioforms"
    description: "The Vyr display real-time morphological adaptation. Armor plating shifts or regenerates under stress, and limbs or weapons may transform mid-combat. Their resilience and versatility make them extremely dangerous opponents."
  - name: "Psionic Interference"
    description: "Proximity to Vyr nests has triggered headaches, hallucinations, and sensor disruptions in multiple agents. Psionic operatives report interference, but direct psionic activity by the Vyr remains unconfirmed. It is likely some units are latent or near the threshold of active psionic capability."

threat_profile:
  - "The Vyr represent an existential threat to Harmonia Astralis and all civilized powers in the sector. Their numbers, autonomy, and resilience demand extreme caution. Containment is the only viable short-term strategy."
  - "Should they develop coordinated psionic warfare or achieve control of additional planetary resources, total war will become inevitable. All field agents are advised to avoid direct engagement outside coordinated military action."
