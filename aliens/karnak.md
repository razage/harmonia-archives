title: Karnak
homeworld: Anisbe (Herte-0211)
threat_level: I / Not capable of rebellion on their own.

description:
  - "Broad-shouldered and bred for resilience, the Karnak evolved on the rugged world of Anisbe—an ash-swept planet of volcanic plains and jagged ridges. Isolated by geography and hardened by centuries of internal conflict, they developed a fierce martial culture that shaped every aspect of their society. Since their introduction to interstellar civilization, Karnak clans have eagerly embraced mercenary work, piracy, and frontier enforcement."
  - "While known for blunt pragmatism and overwhelming force, Karnak honor-codes are highly structured, often prioritizing loyalty and retribution over abstract ideals. Despite occasional disciplinary incidents, their discipline under contract and raw battlefield utility make them a common sight in conflicts throughout the outer systems."

traits:
  - name: "Combat Instinct"
    description: "+1 to Attack Bonus, regardless of class"
  - name: "Bloodied Legacy"
    description: Once per scene, a Karnak may invoke their ancestral combat heritage to reroll a failed hit, saving throw, or physical skill check. This must be declared immediately after the failure, before knowing the outcome.
  - name: "Warrior Genes"
    description: Thick hide, reinforced bones, and compact musculature grant an innate Armor Class of 15. This does not stack with worn armor, but is always active otherwise.
  - name: "Heavy Handed"
    description: Dextrous tasks are difficult. -1 penalty to DEX bonus.

threat_profile:
  - "Karnak populations are not inherently hostile but may be unpredictable when clan loyalties override contractual obligations. Most are motivated by material gain, reputation, or vendetta, making them manipulatable if approached correctly. Combat capability is significant; avoid provoking them without a clear numerical or technological advantage."
  - "Recommended Strategy: Favor diplomatic engagement via clan elders or warband captains. Use asset denial, precision strikes, or honor-based leverage to redirect aggression or secure compliance."
