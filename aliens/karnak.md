title: Karnak
homeworld: Anisbe (Herte-0211)
threat_level: II / Moderate threat, but not capable of serious rebellion on their own.

description:
  - 'The Karnak are a formidable, stocky, and broad-shouldered species hailing from the harsh, ash-strewn world of Anisba, marked by jagged mountains and deep-seated tribal rivalries. Shaped by centuries of clan warfare, they embody disciplined ferocity, guided by a cultural code that venerates loyalty, vengeance, and honor. While their history is steeped in conflict, off-world contact has transformed the Karnari into professional mercenaries and traders, offering their martial prowess to those who earn their respect. Known as "Karnari" in plural, derogatory terms such as "Ash-Dogs" or "Bone-Biters" are ill-advised, often provoking violent retribution. Harmonia Astralis views the Karnak as a dual-purpose asset: exceptional warriors for hire, but a potential threat if their loyalty is mishandled, given their capacity for organized resistance and unrelenting vendettas.'
  - "Karnak stand 6–8 feet tall with massive, muscular frames supported by dense skeletal structures. Their ashen gray to earthy brown skin is leathery and armor-like, often reinforced by calcified bone plates across the arms, chest, and face. These plates, sometimes exposed and ornamented with carvings or stains, signify strength or lineage. Enlarged lower canines protrude as tusk-like teeth, occasionally capped with metal for martial clans, enhancing their intimidating presence."

traits:
  - name: "Warrior's Instinct"
    description: "Ingrained combat training from youth grants all Karnak a +1 bonus to their Attack Bonus, regardless of class. This universal martial proficiency ensures that even non-combatant Karnak, such as scholars or engineers, are capable fighters, making them unpredictable and dangerous in any confrontation."
  - name: Ancestral Fury
    description: The Karnak possess a Fury Pool equal to their Constitution modifier (minimum 1). As an instant action, they may spend 1 point to reroll a failed hit, saving throw, or physical skill check, declared immediately after the failure without knowing the outcome. If the reroll fails, they suffer 1 psychic damage that bypasses armor, representing ancestral disapproval. Fury points regenerate after a full night's rest or a one-hour Anisban ritual (requiring elements like fire, drummers, sacrifices, moonlight, or specific locations, varying by tribe). Rituals may only be performed once daily to avoid ancestral displeasure.
  - name: "Natural Armor"
    description: The Karnak's leathery skin and calcified bone plates provide an innate Armor Class of 12 plus their Constitution modifier (rounded up, minimum 0), active even when unarmored. This does not stack with worn armor; use the higher AC value. This natural defense gives Karnak a significant advantage in low-tech or surprise encounters.

threat_profile:
  - "Karnak populations are not inherently hostile but may be unpredictable when clan loyalties override contractual obligations. Most are motivated by material gain, reputation, or vendetta, making them manipulatable if approached correctly. Combat capability is significant; avoid provoking them without a clear numerical or technological advantage."
  - "Recommended Strategy: Favor diplomatic engagement via clan elders or warband captains. Use asset denial, precision strikes, or honor-based leverage to redirect aggression or secure compliance."
