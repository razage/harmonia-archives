homeworld: Unnhild (Jahni-0701)
threat_level: III / Highly adaptable to any environment.

description:
  - "The Thrynn are a photosynthetic species adapted to the dense, competitive biosphere of Unnhild. Their physiology blends plant and animal traits, with chlorophyll-rich skin, semi-rigid vines in place of hair, and a circulatory system that metabolizes both sunlight and organic fuel. While individually strong, their true advantage lies in their symbiosis with Unnhild’s fauna—beasts that have been selectively bred, conditioned, or partially uplifted over generations to serve as workers, protectors, and war-beasts."
  - "Though culturally diverse, nearly all Thrynn share a spiritual bond with their ecosystem and a belief that harmony with nature must be earned, not imposed. Their largest settlements integrate trees, roots, and cliff faces into immense vertical cities that rise above the canopy to bask in the sun. Offworld, they often bring seedstock or companion species with them, which has led to more than one ecological incident."

traits:
    - name: "Photosynthetic Metabolism"
      description: "Thrynn gain nourishment from direct sunlight or equivalent sythetic sources. If they bask in this light for at least an hour, they do not need to eat. Afterwards, they gain temporary hit points equal to half their level (minimum 1, rounded down). These hit points cannot be recovered once lost until the following day."
    - name: "Natural Immunity"
      description: "Immune to mundane diseases and common organic toxins."

threat_profile:
  - "While not generally aggressive or expansionist, Thrynn settlements have shown alarming adaptive potential when provoked. Their reliance on trained beasts complicates standard military suppression protocols, and their cities are often biologically fused with native terrain, making orbital strikes ineffective 
  without ecological fallout. Caution is advised during engagement—especially if a bonded creature is killed in the Thrynn’s presence."
  - "Field units should also note the species’ sensory adaptation to sunlight and canopy cover; they may be less effective in sterile or subterranean environments. Still, their tactical flexibility and ecosystem-based warfare doctrine make them ideal partners or problematic insurgents, depending on alignment."
