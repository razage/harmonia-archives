threat_level: III / Highly adaptable to any environment.

description:
  - 'The Thrynn are a photosynthetic, humanoid plant-like species from the verdant world of Unnhild, deeply attuned to sunlight and natural cycles. Their culture emphasizes peace, patience, and philosophical reflection, centered on solar rhythms and environmental harmony. Referred to as "Thrynn" in both singular and plural, derogatory terms like "Leaf-Hearts" or "Glow-Weeds" are strongly discouraged, as they may provoke defensive reactions. While generally non-aggressive, Thrynn fiercely protect natural sanctuaries and sacred solar sites, demonstrating unexpected resilience in defense. Harmonia Astralis views them as valuable for ecological operations and diplomatic outreach, but their dependence on sunlight and potential for territorial zeal pose risks of localized resistance if their environments are threatened.'
  - "Thrynn possess chlorophyll-rich skin ranging from muted green to bronze, adorned with fine, leaf-like scales along shoulders, arms, and backs. Their vine-like or petal-like hair is often braided with living fungi or blossoms, exuding a unique floral, earthy, or sweet scent. A vivid chest flower serves as a vital core, its color and shape unique to each individual, fading with age as a sign of natural decline. Thorn-like growths replace fingernails, with additional forearm thorns in some individuals. Symbiotic bioluminescent fungi create glowing patterns, varying with emotion or time of day. Thrynn rely on sunlight and hydration, becoming sluggish and dull without either, though they can consume food like humanoids."

traits:
    - name: "Photosynthetic Metabolism"
      description: "Thrynn store energy from sunlight in a Solar Vigor pool equal to their Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). After 1 hour in bright natural sunlight or high-intensity synthetic light (e.g., UV grow lamps), they gain 1 point, up to the pool’s maximum, with points refreshing daily at dawn or after a full rest in light. As an Instant action, they may spend 1 point to gain one of the following for 1 minute: heal 1d4 hit points, +2 meters to movement speed, or +2 to a physical skill check. Without sunlight for 24 hours, they lose all points and suffer a -1 penalty to all skill checks until re-exposed. After 72 hours, they gain 1 level of Exhaustion daily until restored. Thrynn do not require traditional food, subsisting on sunlight and water, though they can consume food if desired."
    - name: "Plant Immunities"
      description: "Thrynn are immune to mundane diseases and take half damage (rounded down) from organic toxins (e.g., venom, plant-based poisons). They gain a +2 bonus to saving throws against inhaled or chemical effects (e.g., gas grenades, pollutants). However, advanced chemical weapons (TL4+) or tailored biotoxins bypass these defenses, dealing full damage."
    - name: "Thorned Defense"
      description: "When struck by a melee attack, Thrynn can reflexively sprout thorns, dealing 1d4 piercing damage to the attacker within 1 meter (no attack roll needed). This costs 1 Solar Vigor point and can be used once per round as a reaction. The damage ignores non-TL4 armor, reflecting ancestral defenses, but is ineffective against ranged or energy attacks."

threat_profile:
  - "While not generally aggressive or expansionist, Thrynn settlements have shown alarming adaptive potential when provoked. Their reliance on trained beasts complicates standard military suppression protocols, and their cities are often biologically fused with native terrain, making orbital strikes ineffective 
  without ecological fallout. Caution is advised during engagement—especially if a bonded creature is killed in the Thrynn’s presence."
  - "Field units should also note the species’ sensory adaptation to sunlight and canopy cover; they may be less effective in sterile or subterranean environments. Still, their tactical flexibility and ecosystem-based warfare doctrine make them ideal partners or problematic insurgents, depending on alignment."
