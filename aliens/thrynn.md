overview:
  - "The Thrynn are a photosynthetic, humanoid plant-like species from the verdant world of Unnhild, deeply attuned to sunlight and natural cycles. Their culture emphasizes peace, patience, and philosophical reflection, centered on solar rhythms and environmental harmony. Referred to as 'Thrynn' in both singular and plural, derogatory terms like 'Leaf-Hearts' or 'Glow-Weeds' are strongly discouraged, as they may provoke defensive reactions. While generally non-aggressive, Thrynn fiercely protect natural sanctuaries and sacred solar sites, demonstrating resilience in defense. Harmonia Astralis views them as valuable for ecological operations and diplomatic outreach, but their dependence on sunlight and potential for territorial zeal pose risks of localized resistance if their environments are threatened."

physical_assessment:
  - title: Physiology
    description: "Thrynn possess chlorophyll-rich skin ranging from muted green to bronze, adorned with fine, leaf-like scales along shoulders, arms, and backs. Their vine-like or petal-like hair is often braided with living fungi or blossoms, exuding a unique floral, earthy, or sweet scent. A vivid chest flower serves as a vital core, its color and shape unique to each individual, fading with age as a sign of natural decline. Thorn-like growths replace fingernails, with additional forearm thorns in some individuals. Symbiotic bioluminescent fungi create glowing patterns, varying with emotion or time of day. Thrynn rely on sunlight and hydration, becoming sluggish and dull without either, though they can consume food like humanoids."
  - title: Strategic Implications
    description: "Their photosynthetic nature limits operational range in low-light environments, but resilience to toxins and diseases makes them ideal for contaminated zones. Thorned defenses deter close-quarters threats, though vulnerability to advanced weaponry requires caution. The chest flower is a potential weak point for targeted strikes."

behavioral_profile:
  - title: Societal Structure
    description: "Thrynn societies are organized around solar cycles, with communal rituals tied to light and growth. Philosophical and ecological priorities foster cooperation, but defense of sacred sites can galvanize militant action. Their reproductive cycle, tied to floral pollination, reinforces their connection to natural systems."
  - title: Behavioral Traits
    description: "Patient and reflective, Thrynn prioritize harmony but are not pacifists, mobilizing decisively to protect natural or cultural assets. Emotional states are signaled through bioluminescent shifts, offering potential for behavioral analysis. Prolonged light deprivation induces psychological distress, impacting reliability."
  - title: Strengths
    description: "Immunity to organic hazards and self-sustaining biology make Thrynn excellent for long-term ecological or exploratory missions. Their thorned defense provides a reliable counter to melee threats, and solar-enhanced abilities enhance versatility in combat or physical tasks."
  - title: Weaknesses
    description: "Dependence on sunlight restricts operations in subterranean or void environments, with predictable penalties after 24 hours. Advanced chemical or bioweaponry negates their immunities, and their chest flower may be exploited as a critical vulnerability. Emotional transparency via bioluminescence can be used for manipulation."
  - title: Strategic Risks
    description: "Thrynn pose minimal expansionist threat but can form zealous resistance groups when sacred sites or ecosystems are endangered. Their ecological expertise could support insurgent sustainability efforts. Monitor solar-dependent colonies for signs of defensive mobilization."

traits:
  - name: "Photosynthetic Biology"
    description: "Thrynn store energy from sunlight in a Solar Vigor pool equal to their Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). After 1 hour in bright natural sunlight or high-intensity synthetic light (e.g., UV grow lamps), they gain 1 point, up to the pool’s maximum, with points refreshing daily at dawn or after a full rest in light. As an Instant action, they may spend 1 point to gain one of the following for 1 minute: heal 1d4 hit points, +2 meters to movement speed, or +2 to a physical skill check. Without sunlight for 24 hours, they lose all points and suffer a -1 penalty to all skill checks until re-exposed. After 72 hours, they gain 1 level of Exhaustion daily until restored. Thrynn do not require traditional food, subsisting on sunlight and water, though they can consume food if desired."
  - name: "Plant Immunities"
    description: "Thrynn are immune to mundane diseases and take half damage (rounded down) from organic toxins (e.g., venom, plant-based poisons). They gain a +2 bonus to saving throws against inhaled or chemical effects (e.g., gas grenades, pollutants). However, advanced chemical weapons (TL4+) or tailored biotoxins bypass these defenses, dealing full damage."
  - name: "Thorned Defense"
    description: "When struck by a melee attack, Thrynn can reflexively sprout thorns, dealing 1d4 piercing damage to the attacker within 1 meter (no attack roll needed). This costs 1 Solar Vigor point and can be used once per round as a reaction. The damage ignores non-TL4 armor, reflecting ancestral defenses, but is ineffective against ranged or energy attacks."

operational_recommendations:
  - title: "Engagement Strategy"
    description: "Deploy Thrynn in sun-rich environments for maximum efficacy, providing synthetic light sources for extended missions. Engage diplomatically by respecting their ecological values to secure cooperation and foster loyalty."
  - title: "Containment Measures"
    description: "Limit Thrynn effectiveness by restricting access to sunlight, forcing operations into low-light or subterranean environments. Deploy TL4+ chemical weapons or energy-based attacks to bypass their immunities and exploit vulnerabilities."
  - title: "Escalation Protocols"
    description: "Neutralize threats with advanced weaponry targeting the chest flower to disrupt vital functions. Avoid desecrating sacred sites to prevent escalation, as such actions may unify Thrynn communities. Target leadership to disrupt communal cohesion in conflict scenarios."
