overview:
  - "The Sareth are a gelatinous, pseudopodic species renowned for their resilience and elusiveness in environments lethal to baseline humanoids. Composed of dense, pliable cellular structures, they excel in infiltration, survival, and post-conflict scenarios, thriving where rigid-bodied species falter. Referred to as 'Sareth' in both singular and plural, derogatory terms like 'Slimes' or 'Gunkers' are strongly discouraged, as they may provoke defensive responses. Harmonia Astralis evaluates the Sareth as valuable for reconnaissance and unconventional operations, but their stealth capabilities and adaptability present risks of undetected subversion or espionage if not closely monitored."

physical_assessment:
  - title: Physiology
    description: "Sareth are semi-transparent gelatinous entities with hues ranging from deep green to luminous blue, maintaining a constant coloration akin to skin tone. Their bodies resemble firm gelatin in a default humanoid form, cool and slightly damp, adapting to ambient temperatures. Lacking fixed skeletons or organs, they fluidly redistribute mass to squeeze through confined spaces, flow over terrain, or reform after blunt impacts. A pair of contrasting-colored eyes, positionable anywhere on or within their form, indicates mood or focus. As hermaphrodites, they adopt gender identities and craft humanoid features (e.g., simulated hair or faces) from their mass for social expression. Communication occurs via vocalized speech with an uncanny, resonant quality."
  - title: Strategic Implications
    description: "Their mutable forms enable unparalleled infiltration and evasion, posing challenges for physical containment. Resilience to blunt trauma is offset by vulnerability to energy and advanced melee weapons. Eye placement offers potential psychological cues for interrogation, though their lack of vital organs complicates traditional medical or lethal protocols."

behavioral_profile:
  - title: Societal Structure
    description: "Sareth society emphasizes adaptability and communal survival, with fluid social roles and anchor forms for interspecies interaction. Their nomadic history fosters resilience over territoriality, leading to integration into diverse crews or colonies rather than independent polities."
  - title: Behavioral Traits
    description: "Perceived as passive due to their physiology, Sareth are capable navigators of violent environments, excelling in stealth and recovery operations. They maintain social continuity through consistent anchor forms but exhibit defensive aggression when threatened, leveraging elusiveness for counterattacks."
  - title: Strengths
    description: "Exceptional in reconnaissance, sabotage, and hazardous environment operations, Sareth's sensor evasion and shapeshifting make them ideal for covert missions. Their resilience to physical trauma enhances longevity in prolonged engagements."
  - title: Weaknesses
    description: "Physical exertion leaves a sticky, iridescent residue detectable for 1 hour, enabling tracking. High-tech scanners negate their stealth, and inability to mimic appearances limits deceptive applications. Environmental extremes (e.g., extreme heat or desiccation) may destabilize their gelatinous forms."
  - title: Strategic Risks
    description: "Sareth infiltration risks undetected access to secure facilities, potentially enabling espionage or disruption. Their adaptability could facilitate alliances with insurgent groups, amplifying threats in unstable sectors. Monitor residue patterns and deploy advanced scanners in sensitive areas."

traits:
  - name: "Shapeshifting Physiology"
    description: "Sareth can squeeze through extremely tight spaces, such as vent shafts or pipe gaps, provided there is at least an inch or two of clearance. They can extrude pseudopods to manipulate tools, press buttons, or handle weapons, extending their reach up to 2 meters, though precision diminishes beyond standard arm's length. They cannot convincingly mimic other species' appearances due to their translucent bodies, limiting impersonation-based infiltration."
  - name: "Shock Absorption"
    description: "Against non-energy kinetic damage (e.g., unarmed strikes, clubs, knives, traditional swords, traditional bullets), Sareth reduce the damage by 1 point per die, to a minimum of 1 per attack. This reduction does not apply to advanced melee weapons of TL4 or higher, engineered to penetrate organic resilience, nor to energy weapons (e.g., lasers, plasma blades, monoblades), which bypass this protection entirely."
  - name: "Sensor-Elusive Biology"
    description: "Sareth emit no standard biosignatures, lacking a heartbeat, conventional breathing, or significant body heat at rest, rendering them undetectable by baseline biometric or thermal sensors unless under physical stress. Exertion (e.g., rapid movement, combat, or shapeshifting) leaves a sticky, iridescent residue detectable by Notice checks (DC 7) or advanced sensors for 1 hour. Military-grade or Sareth-specific scanners (TL4+) can identify their unique cellular vibrations, nullifying stealth advantages."

operational_recommendations:
  - title: "Engagement Strategy"
    description: "Integrate Sareth into specialized reconnaissance units with oversight to prevent independent actions. Respect their fluid identities to foster loyalty, offering environments suited to their physiology to maximize effectiveness."
  - title: "Containment Measures"
    description: "Counter Sareth stealth with advanced TL4+ detection suites and residue-neutralizing agents. Employ energy-based restraints and desiccation fields to limit mobility in containment scenarios."
  - title: "Escalation Protocols"
    description: "Neutralize threats with energy weapons or advanced melee armaments to bypass their resilience. Target high-exertion scenarios to exploit residue trails, disrupting their ability to evade detection. Avoid direct confrontation in confined spaces where their shapeshifting provides tactical advantages."
