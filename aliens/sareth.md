title: Sareth
homeworld: Muhani (Azi-0800)
threat_level: II / Low cognitive initiative; high tactical value under direction

description:
  - The Sareth are gelatinous, pseudopodic organisms adapted to survive the hostile aquatic conditions of Muhani—an oceanic world known for its violent, unpredictable weather and pressure extremes. Their physiology is dense yet flexible, allowing them to flow through tight spaces and recover from injuries that would kill most lifeforms.
  - While often underestimated due to their non-humanoid form and diminished intellect, Sareth have proven invaluable in specific operational contexts. Infiltration, sabotage, and high-risk recovery operations benefit from their unique resilience and elusive biological profile. Despite their usefulness, oversight is advised; Sareth do not always understand the full consequences of the tasks they are given.

traits:
  - name: "Shapeshifting Physiology"
    description: "Can squeeze through tight spaces and extrude pseudopods for tool use. Extended reach up to 2 meters, though precision declines beyond normal arm's length."
  - name: "Shock Absorption"
    description: "Reduces kinetic damage by 1 per die (min 1). Ineffective against TL4+ weapons or energy weapons."
  - name: "Sensor-Elusive Biology"
    description: "Undetectable by standard biometric and thermal scanners. Leaves sticky iridescent residue that may be traceable by visual tracking."

threat_profile:
  - "Sareth rarely initiate action without direction and are not considered tactically independent. However, their ability to bypass security systems, elude sensors, and survive high-risk environments makes them dangerous in the hands of hostile actors."
  - "Recommended Strategy: Avoid closed-quarters encounters. Thermal surge detection or Sareth-specific tracking algorithms may assist with interception. If possible, negotiate with handlers or employers rather than the Sareth directly."
