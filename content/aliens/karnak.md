overview:
  - "The Karnak are a formidable, stocky, and broad-shouldered species from the harsh, ash-strewn world of Anisba, marked by jagged mountains and deep-seated tribal rivalries. Shaped by centuries of clan warfare, they embody disciplined ferocity, guided by a cultural code that venerates loyalty, vengeance, and honor. Known as 'Karnari' in plural, derogatory terms such as 'Ash-Dogs' or 'Bone-Biters' are ill-advised, often provoking violent retribution. Their transition to professional mercenaries and traders has extended their influence across the sector. Harmonia Astralis views the Karnak as exceptional warriors for hire, but their capacity for organized resistance and unrelenting vendettas poses a significant threat if loyalty is mishandled."

physical_assessment:
  - title: Physiology
    description: "Karnak stand 6–8 feet tall with massive, muscular frames supported by dense skeletal structures. Their ashen gray to earthy brown skin is leathery and armor-like, often reinforced by calcified bone plates across the arms, chest, and face, sometimes exposed and ornamented with carvings or stains to signify strength or lineage. Enlarged lower canines protrude as tusk-like teeth, occasionally capped with metal in martial clans, enhancing their intimidating presence."
  - title: Strategic Implications
    description: "Their physical prowess makes Karnak devastating in close combat, with natural armor and strength enabling dominance in unarmored or melee scenarios. Their size and bone structure require heavy weaponry for effective neutralization. Low-tech environments amplify their threat due to innate defenses, though advanced weaponry can exploit gaps in their resilience."

behavioral_profile:
  - title: Societal Structure
    description: "Karnari society revolves around tribal clans, each governed by a code of honor and martial tradition. Loyalty to clan and ancestors supersedes external allegiances, with warbands forming tight-knit units that operate as both family and fighting force. Their mercenary activities have expanded this structure across the sector without diminishing clan cohesion."
  - title: Behavioral Traits
    description: "Disciplined and fiercely loyal, Karnak are driven by honor and vengeance. They respond poorly to perceived disrespect or betrayal, with grudges often escalating to clan-wide conflicts. Their professional demeanor as mercenaries masks a volatile temperament when provoked."
  - title: Strengths
    description: "Exceptional warriors and tacticians, Karnak excel in high-intensity combat and disciplined operations. Their ability to function as cohesive units makes them ideal for coordinated assaults or defense, with natural armor enhancing resilience in diverse environments."
  - title: Weaknesses
    description: "Reliance on ancestral rituals for certain abilities can be disrupted by denying access to ritual components or locations. Zero-gravity environments slightly impair coordination due to their massive frames, though less severely than other species. Their rigid honor code can be manipulated to provoke internal strife."
  - title: Strategic Risks
    description: "Karnak pose a significant threat if unified under a single cause, capable of forming warbands that could challenge Harmonian outposts. Their mercenary nature makes them susceptible to financial inducements, but betrayal risks long-term retaliation. Monitor inter-clan communications for signs of unification or large-scale contracts."

traits:
  - name: "Warrior's Instinct"
    description: "Ingrained combat training from youth grants all Karnak a +1 bonus to their Attack Bonus, regardless of class. This universal martial proficiency ensures that even non-combatant Karnak, such as scholars or engineers, are capable fighters, making them unpredictable and dangerous in any confrontation."
  - name: "Ancestral Fury"
    description: "Karnak possess a Fury Pool equal to their Constitution modifier (minimum 1). As an instant action, they may spend 1 point to reroll a failed hit, saving throw, or physical skill check, declared immediately after the failure without knowing the outcome. If the reroll fails, they suffer 1 psychic damage that bypasses armor, representing ancestral disapproval. Fury points regenerate after a full night's rest or a one-hour Anisban ritual (requiring elements like fire, drummers, sacrifices, moonlight, or specific locations, varying by tribe). Rituals may only be performed once daily to avoid ancestral displeasure."
  - name: "Natural Armor"
    description: "The Karnak's leathery skin and calcified bone plates provide an innate Armor Class of 12 plus their half of their level (rounded up, minimum 1), active even when unarmored. This does not stack with worn armor; use the higher AC value."

operational_recommendations:
  - title: "Engagement Strategy"
    description: "Engage Karnak through contractual agreements, offering substantial resources to secure loyalty. Frame partnerships as honorable alliances to align with their cultural values and ensure compliance."
  - title: "Containment Measures"
    description: "Disrupt ritual sites or access to components to limit their Ancestral Fury capabilities. Deploy in high-combat scenarios to leverage their strengths, but introduce internal provocations to fracture clan unity in zero-gravity environments."
  - title: "Escalation Protocols"
    description: "Prioritize overwhelming force to counter their durability and coordination, targeting leadership to disrupt clan cohesion. Avoid direct conflict unless clan mobilizations exceed critical thresholds (approximately 500 individuals), as their sustained resistance requires strategic isolation or heavy weaponry."
