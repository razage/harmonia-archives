        - name: Basilica of the Penitent
          description: "A breathtaking cathedral that serves as both spiritual center and seat of governance. Its opulent interior and serene vivarium courtyard are accessible only to the most devout. Those not granted entry may still participate in outdoor sermons broadcast through speakers."
        - name: Unity Holdings, Inc Corporate Headquarters
          description: "An elegant skyscraper that stands as a symbol of economic presence on Meda. The top-floor penthouse offers panoramic views of the city. Many locals find employment here in various capacities."
        - name: Jakobsen Imports 
          description: "A respected trading firm facilitating the flow of select off-world goods to Meda's markets, making exotic items available within the bounds of local regulations."
    - name: Kolvefoss 
      description: "A peaceful agricultural village now functioning as a suburb of the expanding Mosvinger. Residents maintain simple, penitent lives focused on faith and traditional farming. Visit farms like the one owned by Emil Brustad for a glimpse of rural Medan life and artisanal crops."

description: "Meda offers a unique and austere experience for the discerning traveler willing to embrace its solemn atmosphere and deep spiritual traditions. Nestled in the Karis system, this cold-to-temperate world of vast taigas and engineered boreal forests welcomes those seeking reflection, cultural immersion, and quiet contemplation under the guidance of The Penitent Crown.

Life on Meda revolves around devotion and humility. The capital, Mosvinger, features grand religious architecture, with the magnificent Basilica of the Penitent rising above the city as a beacon of faith. Sealed and pressurized buildings provide comfortable living spaces, while carefully managed public areas maintain an atmosphere of solemn reverence. Visitors may observe daily rituals, attend approved sermons (from designated outdoor speaker zones for non-initiates), and explore the disciplined beauty of this world.

Business travelers will find opportunities through established firms such as Unity Holdings, Inc., whose impressive headquarters stands as a modern counterpoint to the traditional skyline, and Jakobsen Imports, which brings select off-world goods to discerning local markets. Nearby agricultural communities like Kolvefoss offer glimpses of traditional rural life and artisanal produce.

Meda is best suited for reflective journeys, academic study of comparative theology, or those conducting legitimate business with proper authorization. The planet rewards those who approach it with respect and openness to its unique path of penitence and devotion.

Pro Tip: Respect local customs regarding lighting and dress at all times. Business visitors are encouraged to schedule meetings through official channels and prepare appropriate documentation. Agricultural products from Kolvefoss make thoughtful, approved gifts for local contacts."
