description: "Aethyll, in the Pertea system, is a TL1 cultural isolate, originally a renaissance-themed colony for historical reenactment. Its inhabitants maintain a feudal society, viewing off-worlders as supernatural entities. Harmonia Astralis enforces strict oversight due to Aethyll’s historical value and potential pretech artifacts embedded in local traditions. Isolation ensures cultural preservation but limits technological development. Strategic value: High for historical analysis and pretech recovery; risks include local superstition and minimal infrastructure."
